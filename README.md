## Code Example
Look at Contents.swift. It is a Swift playgrounds file. Run the GET function by adding the following to line 67
```
getRequest() // starts GET request on given URL
postRequest() // starts POST request on given URL with payload that you supplied
```
The example uses JSONPlaceholder to supply the example with fake json. The GET request function will return json from JSON Placeholder inside the console. The POST request will return a HTTP Status code of 201 "OK" inside the console.

## How to use?
You can use this in your iOS projects by changing the url in each function. An example for supplying the function with a url (replace "YOUR-OWN-URL" with an actual url that serves some json):
```
let url = URL(string: "https://YOUR-OWN-URL")!
```
